# etchv3 (version three)

# live applications:

## - version one: https://michaelleojacob.github.io/etch_a_sketch/

## - version two: https://michaelleojacob.github.io/etch_a_sketch_additional_features/

## - version three: https://michaelleojacob.github.io/etchv3/

# this version is the finished product at least for now. I'm very happy with how it turned out.

# Highlights:

> grid is created, updated and made dynamic on user input using the slider.

> mouse over works. Color can be adjusted using the buttons at the top.

> random color and rainbow buttons work.

> reset button works.

# Some of my biggest challenges for this project:

> Making the grid dynamic. Solution I implemented was to move the css to javascript so I may use the setproperty with a js variable.

> Allowing the mouse over to work on the different grids, be the default grid (on page load), or larger/smaller grids. I wasn't exactly sure how to tackle going through each grid item and adding a mouseover effect.

> the buttons to change color.

> finding a way to have the mouse over pick a random color.

# As mentioned, this is the final product. At least for now. Thank you all for checking out my project.
